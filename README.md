# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
As an analyst for PyBer (the most up-and-coming ride-hailing service), it is my job to analyze our data and create visual representations and reports that cleary summarize the findings to our CEO, V. Isualize. In this analysis, our purpose is to create a DataFrame that will summarize our data by city-type: Urban, Suburban and Rural. After creating the DataFrame, we need to create a graph that can visually show the total weekly fares for each of the city types.

## Results
When breaking it down to the different city types, we can really see how our business is broken down over the different market segments. It may be no suprise to you or anyone reading this, but most of our business is done in Urban cities. As you can see below, when broken down, the 'Total Rides by City Type' show that almost 70% of our business (68.4%) is done in Urban cities.

As seen below, you can also see that this correlates with how many drivers we contract out to drive for us as well. With 80.9% of all PyBer drivers, being drivers in Urban cities.

This is furthermore continued to our prices and how much PyBer makes from the fares. As seen below, 62.7% of all the money generated by PyBer is coming from Urban cities.

However, what these pie charts wont tell you is the actual numbers behind the percentages. If you see below, you can see that average fare per ride is much lower in the Urban cities than it is in the Rural cities. If you continue over to the right of the chart, you would see that this correlates with the 'Average Fare per Driver'. If you are a driver, you will make the most money per ride given in a Rural city. However, I believe the most success we could see is within our Suburban cities. The average fare rate is right in between its Rural and Urban city counterparts, and the total fares generated is about 1/2 of the Urban cities with only 20% of the drivers and 38% of the total rides.

When we look at our data from the beginning of the year until the end of April, we can see that each city type sees the same upward blips and downward spikes in total fares for a specified week. This is likely in part due to the change in seasons from Winter to the Spring and in the middle of March is Spring Break, which is a huge time of the year for people to get out of their homes and to get outside. We see the biggest deviations in 'Total Fares' for the Urban cities because of the sheer population density and increase in market competition from other ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber. I believe the most success we could see is within our Suburban cities. The average fare rate is right in between its Rural and Urban city counterparts.

## Summary
Now, as an analyst it is also my job to provide business recommendations for addressing these disparities among the city types. 
- To begin, the main disparity between the city types is population density. With an increase in population, you're going to have an increase in demand for services, as well as an increase of people just looking for employment. 
  - This strictly correlates to our data, as we can see that as the city types change from Rural to Urban, so does the volume of our business.
- When we look at the differences in 'Average Fare per Ride' and 'Average Fare per Driver' we can see that in Rural cities, the ride service will be a bit more expensive.
- This is likely related to 2 things:
  - For one, the supply of drivers in Rural cities is significantly less than that of their Suburban and Urban counterparts. 
  - Secondly, the average distance per ride in a Rural city, is probably a bit longer, therefore making the ride longer, therefore making the fare for that ride more expensive. This is strictly just due to geography, typically Rural cities are very spread out and the per mile distance is likely to be more.
- Lastly, we can see the Suburban cities fit right in the middle of Rural and Urban cities. This is exactly where we want to see it, because the supply drivers and demand is less than the Urban cities. However, those metrics are higher than the Rural cities, therfore putting our Suburban trends right in the middle.
